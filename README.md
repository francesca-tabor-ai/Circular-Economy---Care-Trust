# CareTrust

## The Product Definition

### The Single Value Prop: Zero-Gap Reliability

We define care as a critical system. When a primary care provider fails, the household economy stalls. CareTrust provides the automated redundancy and verified human nodes required to keep the system running.

### Key Metrics

- **Availability**: 99.9%
- **Match Success Rate**: SLA
- **Emergency Response**: 120m

### Core Functional Requirements

1. **Predictability** - Standardized pricing and hour-based care budgeting.
2. **Verification** - Multi-factor background, skill, and EQ assessments.
3. **Redundancy** - Instant failover to backup providers when primary care defaults.
4. **Intelligence** - AI-generated briefs ensuring flawless handovers.

### System Specifications

The engineering behind our "Trust Protocol."

**BUILD: CT_PROD_ALPHA_2025**

- **Dynamic Matching** - Real-time routing of providers based on location, availability, and specific child needs.
- **Briefing Engine** - LLM-driven analysis of family routines to provide providers with actionable care data.
- **Secure Logs** - End-to-end encrypted session reports and health tracking for total parental transparency.

### A Message from the Founder

> "Reliability is a design problem. We spent decades optimizing cloud infrastructure and logistics networks, yet we left the most critical part of our social infrastructure—childcare—to chance."
>
> "CareTrust is my attempt to apply systems thinking to care. We aren't just matching you with a person; we are enrolling you in a network that refuses to fail. We've built the redundancy, the verification layers, and the intelligence engine so that you can focus on the work that matters, knowing your foundation is solid."
