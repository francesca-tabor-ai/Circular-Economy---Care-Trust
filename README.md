# CareTrust

## The Product Definition

### The Single Value Prop: Circular Economy Care Networks

We apply circular economy principles to childcare. When care needs arise, community networks respond — resources circulate, they don't break down. CareTrust builds community-owned infrastructure that reduces waste, builds resilience, and keeps care flowing locally.

### Key Metrics

- **Availability**: 99.9%
- **Match Success Rate**: SLA
- **Emergency Response**: 120m

### Core Functional Requirements

1. **Circular Networks** - Community-owned care networks that keep resources circulating locally.
2. **Shared Resources** - Reduced waste through shared economy models and community resilience.
3. **Community Infrastructure** - Local networks that respond when care needs arise.
4. **Sustainability** - Economic models that support local providers and reduce resource waste.

### A Message from the Founder

> "The circular economy isn't just about products — it's about how we organize care. We've applied circular economy principles to build community-owned care networks that reduce waste, build resilience, and keep resources circulating locally."
>
> "CareTrust is my attempt to apply circular economy thinking to childcare. We aren't just matching you with a person; we're building community infrastructure. Care circulates within communities, it doesn't break down. We've built the networks, the shared resources, and the community models so that care becomes sustainable, resilient infrastructure."
